        "# Measuring Word Similarity with BERT (English Language Public Domain Poems)\n",
        "\n",
        "By [The BERT for Humanists](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/BERT-for-Humanists/) Team\n",
        "\n",
        "How can we measure the similarity of words in a collection of texts? For example, how similar are the words \"nature\" and \"science\" in a collection of 16th-20th century English language poems? Do 20th-century poets use the word \"science\" differently than 16th-century poets? Can we map all the different uses and meanings of the word \"nature\"?\n",
        "\n",
        "The short answer is: yes! We can explore all of these questions with BERT, a natural language processing model that has revolutionized the field.\n",
        "\n",
        "BERT turns words or tokens into vectors — essentially, a list of numbers in a coordinate system (x, y). We can then use the geometric similarity between these resulting vectors as a way to represent varying types of similarity between words.\n",
        "\n",
        "## In This Notebook\n",
        "In this Colab notebook, we will specifically analyze a collection of poems scraped from [Public-Domain-Poetry.com](http://public-domain-poetry.com/) with the [DistilBert model](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/distilbert.html) and the HuggingFace Python library. DistilBert is a smaller — yet still powerful! — version of BERT. By using the rich representations of words that BERT produces, we will then explore the multivalent meanings of particular words in context and over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "We hope this notebook will help illustrate how BERT works, how well it works, and how you might use BERT to explore the similarity of words in a collection of texts. It is surprising, for example, that BERT works as well as it does, without any fine-tuning, on poems that were published hundreds of years before the text data it was trained on (Wikiepdia pages and self-published novels). \n",
        "\n",
        "But we also hope that these results will expose some of the limitations and challenges of BERT. We have to disregard poetic line breaks, for example, and we see that BERT has trouble with antiquated words like \"thine,\" which don't show up in its contemporary vocabulary."
