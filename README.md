[Copy_of_BeccaCohen_2](https://github.com/beccacohen23/FemaleAgencyTamerTaming/blob/main/Copy_of_BeccaCohen2.ipynb) contains code for creating the Tamer Tamed dataframe <br />
<br />
[Creatingtamingdatasetattempt 2](https://github.com/beccacohen23/FemaleAgencyTamerTaming/blob/main/creatingtamingdatasetattempt2.ipynb) contains code for creating the Taming dataframe <br />
<br />
[powerframes](https://github.com/beccacohen23/FemaleAgencyTamerTaming/blob/main/powerframes.ipynb) contains the code for lemmatizing the dataframes, and iterating/matching verbs in the connotation frames to each line of the play to get the power and agency scores <br />
<br />
[TamerTamedlinecounts](https://github.com/beccacohen23/FemaleAgencyTamerTaming/blob/main/TamerTamedlinecounts.ipynb) contains code for getting word counts,line counts, verb counts in order to normalize the data <br />
<br />
[TamerTamedAnalysisNormalized](https://github.com/beccacohen23/FemaleAgencyTamerTaming/blob/main/TamerTamedAnalysisNormalized.ipynb) and [TamerTamedAnalysisRawCounts](https://github.com/beccacohen23/FemaleAgencyTamerTaming/blob/main/TamerTamedAnalysisRawCounts.ipynb) contain the non-spacy original analytics <br />
<br />
The above analytics for Tamer Tamed are included within [analytics_for_taming_act_bd](https://github.com/beccacohen23/FemaleAgencyTamerTaming/blob/main/analytics_for_taming_w_act_bd.ipynb) (act_bd refers to the addition of act breakdowns since they were not originally easy to incoporate and I went back and added them later) <br />
<br />
[tamingwpunc](https://github.com/beccacohen23/FemaleAgencyTamerTaming/blob/main/tamingwpunc.ipynb), [TamerTamedwpunctuation](https://github.com/beccacohen23/FemaleAgencyTamerTaming/blob/main/TamerTamedwpunctuation.ipynb) and [tamertamedwpunc2](https://github.com/beccacohen23/FemaleAgencyTamerTaming/blob/main/tamertamedwpunc2.ipynb) contain code for adding punctuation back in to split up the text by sentences, since originally punctuation was removed, and sentences could not be seperated well enough to determine the subject of a single sentence\ <br />
<br />
[SPACYwithsentences_Taming](https://github.com/beccacohen23/FemaleAgencyTamerTaming/blob/main/SPACYwithsentences_Taming.ipynb) and [SPACYwithsentencestamertamed](https://github.com/beccacohen23/FemaleAgencyTamerTaming/blob/main/SPACYwithsentencestamertamed.ipynb) contain the above analysis steps, but repeated with spacy to pull out the subjects per sentence instead of per speaker line (as it was earlier) <br />
<br />
[analytics_for_tamer_withSPACY](https://github.com/beccacohen23/FemaleAgencyTamerTaming/blob/main/analytics_for_tamer_withSPACY_.ipynb) and [analytics_for_tamer_with_act_bd](https://github.com/beccacohen23/FemaleAgencyTamerTaming/blob/main/analytics_for_taming_w_act_bd.ipynb) contain the final analytics, and some of the most important graphs used in the final thesis paper <br />
